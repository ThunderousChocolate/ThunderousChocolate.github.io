	<h2>       As mentioned on the home page, I am going to be a sophmore at North High School this upcoming fall. I intend to stay in Robotics and all the other clubs I've mentioned so far until I graduate. Sophmore year I am going into the school year as the President of K-pop club and very likely I will continue being the Secretary of both Spanish and Asian Studies Club. I am also the new Safety Captain of my Robotics team. I am also the Treasurer of Be A Leader. North High School is mainly recognized as an "IB School" obviously because we have an IB program there. Although I will not be taking the full course (as I will be taking AP classes as a Sophmore as well) I will be taking some IB classes. Despite the fact that I am only in my second year of High School, I am currently two years ahead in math and one year ahead in science. So instead of taking geometry and biology, I will be taking Pre-Calculus(IB) and Physics(AP). In addition, I wil also be in my second year of Honors Chinese (Since there was'nt an IB class for it). I plan to get a job during sophmore year but if I get to busy I will refrain from getting one until I am least busy as I do not want to hinder my educational performance. </h2>
