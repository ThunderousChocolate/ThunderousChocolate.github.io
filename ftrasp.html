    <h2>     Although I'm not entirely sure about what I want to do/be in the future, I do know that I definately want to attend Universty and I have a vague idea of what I'm interested in. My interests lie in both the world of Dance and the field of Criminal Profiling. I love to dance but I also like to understand a criminals way of thinking. I'll admit that what got me into Criminal Profiling in the first place is this show called Criminal Minds. I was obsessed with it (and still am) and while I was watching it, I thought that I would actually consider doing that when I get older. As for dance, there is this group that I admire called BTS and they are a boy band that sings, raps, and dances. They are mainly known for dancing. Anyway, dancing as a career never even crossed my mind until I discovered them about two-to-three years ago and now its something I really enjoy doing. They put so much emotion depending on the song and its like you can feel the lyrics in their movements. They are very passionate about what they do and they are amazing at it so I aspire to be as good as them. Dancing is something I do wherever and whenever and I would love to have a group of people who feel the same and are willing to practice with me. Keeping all of this in mind, I thought it would be a good idea to double major in both Dance and Forensics just in case I am still indecisive about what I want to do later on in life. I still have about two-and-a-half years left to give it some thought though. </h2>
