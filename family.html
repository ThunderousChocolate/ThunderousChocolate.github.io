	<h1> Biological Family </h1>
</head> </center>
	<h2>     I currently have three people in my biological family: my mom, older sister and little brother. My parents got divorced in the middle of my 8th grade year and although I dont necessarily hate my father, he hasn't been around long enough for me to consider him a big part of my life. I also have an "older brother" but as a result of some events, he has been stripped of that title and is still in the process of attempting to earn it back. They annoy me to no ends but I love them anyway. I mean how could I not. We have a weird sense of humor and although it seems hilarious to us, it seems to offend some people so we usually only makes jokes between us and others who appreiate our hilarity. We all have a deep love for food and we eat a lot so when we go grocery shopping it's a war. We all want something for ourselves and they are almost always something big. Even when we do get to do this, we end up eating each other's in secret and get angry when we find our food missing. We clash a lot but surprisingly we get along pretty well. </h2>

		<h2> Something I've learned over the past few years is that family does not always have to be someone who is blood related to you. Family is someone you love who loves you back and will always be there for you no matter what. The other members of my family include everyone on the robotics team that were there consistently throughout the year. These are the people who accepted, joked around and helped me from the moment I joined the club. I spent the majority of my time with them and they had proved to be trustworthy. I didn't want to get attatched to them or become friends with them in the beginning, in fact I joined the club on accident, but it ended up happening anyway and I don't regret a thing. They push me to do my best and motivate me to keep on going even when I'm feeling down and although I don't share my problems with anyone, I don't have to because they make me feel better either way. I've learned that I cannot stay angry with them for very long and they are companions I wish to keep in touch with forever. Other members of my family include: Riana Serna, Selena Gonzales, Riya Bahkta and Archana Ward. These are people I don't get to see all the time but I always try to find time to meet with them. I've known all of them for about three-to-four years and I will never get tired of them. We hang out when we see each other at school, we have sleepovers and parties just for the sake of being with eachother. I also consider the members of my k-pop club as family as well as they are people who share the same interests with me and I love being around them. We are always trying to find excuses to meet eachother whether its practice or a party for some occasion we've made up. They're a bunch of nerds and I love them. I find it easy to talk with them and we all seem to care deeply for one another. As you can see, family does not always have to be blood related and usually are the ones you meet along the way in life. Family isn't as dull as "just being someone I'm related to". </h2>
