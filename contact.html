	<h1> Coding Portfolio </h1>
	</head>
	<h2>HTML and CSS<br> Today I learned how to code using HTML and CSS and began delving into the concept of web programming which is obviously being displayed as I type this. I learned that coding is k-sensitive and even the smallest mistake could make all of your code go awry.</br> </h2>
	<h2>Hackers and JavaScript<br>Today I learned that there are two types of hackers, white hat hackers (good) and black hat hackers (bad) and the dangers the black hat hackers present to the internet society. I now know ways to be careful about the information on the internet and I understand how all of our sensitive files are kept hidden and coded. I learned how to use a little bit of JavaScript functions as well and I have incorporated them into my website.</br> </h2>
	<h2>Caesar's Cipher<br> We learned how to use and code Caesar's Cipher. We learned how loops, functions and other things of that sort are incorporated into coding Caesar's Cipher in order to make it harder to crack.</br> </h2>
	<h2>Python<br>We learned how coding using Python was incorporated in areas such as Social Media. We learned how to make "posts" and how to "add friends" using Python and how to create functions that carry out a certain task based on keywords.</br> </h2>
	<h2>Robotics<br> We put together and coded our smart car. We coded it so that the car moves forward and backwards and stops when it comes into certain proximity of an object but we haven't figured out how to make it so the car goes straight forward. As of right now, the left motor seems to have more power causing the car to turn consistently despite the coding being set for both of the motors to run using equal power. We think it may be a problem with the actual motor itself. Theres resistance coming from inside the right motor which makes it less powerful than the left. I think the motor might have something inside that is causing this but until we can figure it out, Sir Charles Timothy Junior the Third (our robot), was a failure.
